Butterfly - A Social Bug Tracker.

# Status

WIP. Probably vaporware.

# What

Bug tracker meant to integrate well with federated social web stuff.
Plans:

* Support webmention, for automatic cross-referencing of issues on
  different trackers.

Questions:

* ActivityPub?
* Single-Sign on? OpenID Connect is pretty gross. Are there other
  options? Do we actually need this?

Focus is on *public* bug trackers, so may not be appropriate if you want
a ticketing system for your private whatever.

# License

AGPLv3+. Will add boilerplate to the repo soon; on my way out the door.
